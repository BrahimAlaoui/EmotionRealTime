Real-Time Emotion Detection Using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
Welcome to the Real-Time Emotion Detection project using CNN! This project enables emotion detection from facial expressions using deep learning techniques.

Steps to Get Started:
Download the Dataset:

Download the dataset from this Kaggle link(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthu017/emotion-detection-fer).
Extract the dataset from the zip file.
Run the Model:

After downloading and extracting the dataset, run the model file.
The training process may take some time. To speed up the training, consider reducing the number of emotions. I recommend keeping only 3 emotions as shown in the project.
Web Application (Optional):

Once the model is trained, the emotion detection app is ready to use.
If you prefer, you can convert this model into a web application for easier access.
Notes:
This project leverages a CNN for real-time emotion recognition based on facial expressions.
You can modify the number of emotions in the dataset to optimize the training time and accuracy.
Thank you for checking out this project! Enjoy exploring and feel free to contribute!
